## Helicopter

### Description

In this assignment, me and my partner Anton created a beyblade with instructions.

### Reflection
I learned different things while co-making the copter:
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* how to use a sweep tool
* connecting the dimensions of the different parts to each other (using variables)

### Reflection
I'd mis-dimensioned one sketch, and it threw the entire part off. I learned that when constrained properly, one mis-dimension can make or break the onject. The probelm was easily fixed with a few changes because I'd constrained the dimensions correctly.

### Reflection
While making the key, I realized that you can use simple tools to create a complicated structure. The key, for example, was a linear pattern, some sketches and an extrude.

### Reflection
This part was one of the easiest. I learned what different mate connecters did, but other than that, it was simply the most satifying part of the process.



## Swing arm

### Description

We created a swing arm in Onshape with instructions and following questions. We had to decide how to create the obect (how to dimension it, when to use constraints, when to sketch and extrude).

### Reflection
I'd learned that drawing the entire object before hand, then dimensioning the sketch with constraints and other tools makes the entire process faster. There are so many tools on Onshape that choosing the correct can be difficult. Using the simplest isn't always the easiest way to complete the assignment. Using a constraint to dimesion the sketch will save you from later trouble you're bound to get into.


## Multi-Part Studio


### Description
We used written instructions to create an object. We had the flexibility to choose how to dimension the object, and what parts we wanted to create first.

### Reflection
I learned that you can constrain dimensions from one sketch to another extrude or sketch. This really helped me because then I wouldn't have to change each individual sketch, I only had to change one or two, and the entire object was dimensioned efficiently.


## Onshape Certification Reflection:


### Description
The score I recieved on the Onshape Certification was appropriate for the preperation I'd put into it. Although I worked on projects that were assigned to us in preperation for the test, thoroughly understanding how to design the products is crucial to learning how to use Onshape effectively. Something that would have helped is assignments to be completed outside of class, with the appropriate tools provided. During the test, I struggled with staying calm when the answers didn't line up; learning test taking stradegies for Engineering tests specifically would have helped students understand how the test worked, and what-not. Personally, I learn better through drilling distinct areas that need imporvement; multiple short assignments targeting specific weak areas in students' knowledge of Onshape would have been beneficial. Overall, if I had better understood how to use Onshape effectively, and stayed calm during the test, my score would have improved.
