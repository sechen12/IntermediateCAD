### Description

In this assignment, me and my partner Anton created a beyblade with instructions.

### Evidence

### Reflection
I learned different things while co-making the copter:
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* how to use a sweep tool
* connecting the dimensions of the different parts to each other (using variables)

### Reflection
I'd mis-dimensioned one sketch, and it threw the entire part off. I learned that when constrained properly, one mis-dimension can make or break the onject. The probelm was easily fixed with a few changes because I'd constrained the dimensions correctly.

### Reflection
While making the key, I realized that you can use simple tools to create a complicated structure. The key, for example, was a linear pattern, some sketches and an extrude.

### Reflection
This part was one of the easiest. I learned what different mate connecters did, but other than that, it was simply the most satifying part of the process.
